# Rediscover Music

This application can replay user's past favorite songs based on user's experience of them.

## Stage - Lab 1 2018.09.14
Creating a main method along with two other methods in the same file. The main method should make calls to the other two methods. There are also print statements in each method.

## Stage - Lab 2 2018.09.19
Created a main method that allow interaction to the users. Currently the program only ask Users to input Song Names and produces a playlist. For further development, I have already included more fields, setters and getters for the class Song. I will add those functionality in the Song Method in next week.

## Stage - Lab 3 2018.09.25
Created tests for every method in Song class and Playlist class. Updated main class for more user interactions

## Stage - Lab 4 2018.10.03
Created Two Interface Queueable and Printable, 
AudioParser, Save and Load Methods, and update main to take in multiple 
audiofiles.

## Stage - Lab 5 2018.10.10
Created Two abstract classes 
AbstractReadableSWritable and AbstractTestPrintable. 
There is also a new behaviour such as audio parser and 
opening multiple files in the main.

## Stage - Lab 6 and 7 2018.10.24
Created multiple exceptions tailored to the Song Playlist AudioParser ... etc
Rewrite tests to accommodate Exceptions 
Dealts with IOE Exceptions by handling them locally in the method
