# Rediscover Music

This application can replay user's past favorite songs based on user's experience of them.

## Stage - Lab 1 2016.09.14
Creating a main method along with two other methods in the same file. The main method should make calls to the other two methods. There are also print statements in each method.

## Stage - Lab 2 2016.09.19
Created a main method that allow interaction to the users. Currently the program only ask Users to input Song Names and produces a playlist. For further development, I have already included more fields, setters and getters for the class Song. I will add those functionality in the Song Method in next week.

## Stage - Lab 3 2016.09.25
Created tests for every method in Song class and Playlist class. Updated main class for more user interactions
